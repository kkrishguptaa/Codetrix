# Climate Change Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing various aspects of climate change using datasets from Kaggle. The analysis includes temperature changes, precipitation patterns, sea level rise, CO2 emissions, and sea ice extent. The datasets are downloaded and processed using the Kaggle API.

## Data Sources
